# customizable neural network
a customizable neural network.
The python file below consists of a customizable neural network which takes input the number of layers to be used excluding the input  layer and the number of units or neurons  to be used in each layer  and also the batch size to be used so that the neural network can use a mini batch, batch or stochastic gradient descent approach  for the optimization of parameters     
This repository also contains a python program based on machine learning which uses the customizable neural network to plot decision boundaries.
It also contains various datasets which can be used for training and plotting decision boundaries using the customizable neural network.
